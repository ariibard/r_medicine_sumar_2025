# Optimizing Public Healthcare Cost Recovery with R
### A Use Case from Argentina

This repository contains the presentation ‚ÄúOptimizing Public Healthcare Cost Recovery with R: A Use Case from Argentina‚Äù, prepared by Ariana Bardauil and Dacio Martinez from the Buenos Aires City Government. The presentation illustrates how R was used to optimize cost recovery processes in the public healthcare system, including data analysis, report automation, and evidence-based decision-making.

### Abstract

This work aims to demonstrate how the implementation of an open-source tool like R can optimize key processes in cost recovery within the public healthcare system, with a direct impact on its efficiency and sustainability.
In Argentina, the healthcare system is organized into three subsystems: the public, social security, and private sectors. In order to reduce health disparities, programs such as SUMAR have been developed. SUMAR seeks to guarantee equitable and quality access to healthcare for the population with exclusive public coverage. Through external funding from non-governmental entities, healthcare providers within the network of the Government of the City of Buenos Aires (CABA) receive financial incentives each time a basic effective coverage (CEB) health service is provided.

In CABA, the widespread use of the Electronic Health Record system across all healthcare providers facilitates the identification and tracking of patients enrolled in the program, enabling longitudinal follow-up and documentation of CEB services delivered. For each individual and each healthcare encounter, the health center receives additional resources.

Within this framework, this public policy makes it possible to transform healthcare services into concrete financial resources. At the Operational Management of Health Information and Statistics, we have a technical team that leverages open-source tools‚Äîparticularly R‚Äîto apply text mining techniques that help identify diagnoses, services, patients, and care pathways relevant to the preparation of the documentation required to access financial incentives.
Our presentation aims to share with the R Medicine community a real-world use case from Latin America that highlights the value of open and sustainable tools in subnational public settings, promoting their adoption where they are most needed. The decision to use free and open-source tools is a strategic one, based on their flexibility to adapt to different technical needs and their long-term sustainability within the public sector. This approach allows for the systematization and acceleration of documentation processes, with a tangible impact on increasing the efficiency and volume of cost recovery efforts under the SUMAR Program.

Throughout the presentation, we intend to show how applying data science tools in real public healthcare settings can lead to innovative solutions. In particular, we seek to highlight R‚Äôs potential to automate administrative workflows, improve process traceability, and transform data into concrete actions with measurable impact.
